    <h1>That time I decided to loss weight</h1>
    <main>
        <p>College was a major adjustment for me. Along with gaining more independence, I was also "stressed, working multiple homework, and I didn't know what I should be eating." That meant I was grabbing what was easy and convenient on a college budget â€” a ton of pizza and burger and any food I could get that free offer by school. And within about a year, I had gained 30 lbs.</p>
        <p>One day, I look at the mirror, I feel disgusting of myself. So I decided to loss weight. Over the next two and a half years, I consistently lost weight, eventually dropping 35 lbs. I used to don't have a neck, I have neck now</p>
        <p>I am heathy and I feel good of myself</p>
